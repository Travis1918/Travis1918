###  (&#x1F539;): Apply Filters to SQL Queries
Description:
Demonstrated proficiency in SQL filtering techniques by analyzing network login data and ensuring secure operations.

Key tasks included:

    -After-Hours Failed Login Attempts: Queried failed login attempts after 6 pm using WHERE and AND clauses to isolate potential security incidents.

    -Date-Specific Login Attempts: Filtered login attempts on specific dates (5/8/22 and 5/9/22) using the OR operator.

    -Country Exclusion: Removed login attempts originating from Mexico using the NOT operator to analyze location-specific data.

    -Department and Location Filtering: Retrieved employees in Marketing from the East office using AND and LIKE operators.

    -Department-Specific Queries: Queried employees in Finance or Sales using OR and excluded IT department employees with NOT.

Skills Applied:

    -SQL filtering with AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE operators.
    -Use of wildcard % for pattern matching.
    -Analysis of log data to detect and investigate potential security incidents.

###  (&#x1F539;): File Permissions in Linux: Security and Access Control
Description:
This project demonstrates how to manage file and directory permissions in Linux using BASH commands to ensure the principle of least privilege. It highlights key tasks involved in controlling access to sensitive files and directories.

Key Tasks Included:

    -Check Permissions: Use ls -la to display current file permissions.

    -Change Permissions: Modify file and directory permissions with chmod to restrict or grant access based on user, group, and others.

    -File Security: Apply specific permission changes to hidden files, regular files, and directories to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

    -Principle of Least Privilege: Enforce strict access controls, removing unnecessary permissions for enhanced security.

Example Commands:

    -ls -la — View all files and permissions, including hidden ones.

    -chmod — Modify permissions for users, groups, and others.

    -ls -l — List file details to verify permission changes.

    -This project showcases essential skills in file security and system administration, ensuring files are accessible only to authorized users.

###  (&#x1F539;): Automating IP Address Updates for Privileged Access Management
This Python-based algorithm automates the process of maintaining an allow-list of privileged IP addresses for secure access control in a healthcare setting. By comparing an allow-list and a remove-list, the algorithm efficiently removes unauthorized IPs and ensures that only valid IPs retain access to sensitive files.

Key Features:

    -Allow-list Automation: Automates the process of updating a list of IPs that are allowed access to sensitive files.    
    -IP Removal: Compares the allow-list with a remove-list, removing IPs that no longer have access privileges.
    -Efficient File Handling: Utilizes Python’s file handling and list manipulation to read, update, and save the list back to the file, ensuring the list is always up-to-date.
Example Workflow:

    -Open and read the current allow_list.txt file.
    -Iterate through a remove_list and remove any matching IP addresses from the allow-list.
    -Write the updated list back to the allow_list.txt file.
Benefits:

    -Security & Compliance: Ensures only authorized IP addresses can access sensitive data.
    -Automation: Streamlines the process of managing access privileges, reducing the risk of human error.
    -Efficient File Updates: Automatically updates the list and minimizes downtime.
    -This project highlights how Python can be leveraged for cybersecurity tasks related to identity and access management, providing a more secure and efficient solution for sensitive information handling.
